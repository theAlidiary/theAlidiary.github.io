# What can you expect from this blog?
This is my first blog. And I hope it would be of great interest to those, who are planning to write their dissertations or for anyone aiming to analyze statistics such as socioeconomic development etc. within or across the countries. In this regard, [World Development Indicators (WDI)](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/), which is one leading open data source, from the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/). It offers statistics on more than 1500 indicators, ranging from 1960 to the latest date, and covering around 200 plus countries. With such an importance, still, for majority of investigators, it is such a daunting process to download data, then clean it and make it ready for the question to be answered. 
However, in this blog I am going to explain it in step by step, how to download, clean, visualize and analyze these statistics within [
R (programming language)] (https://www.r-project.org/about.html). Where you donâ€™t need to visit any external site, or open Excel etc.
To make it more interactive, I have tried to explain these with three example indicators: Military expenditure (% of GDP); Government expenditure on education, total (% of GDP) and Current health expenditure (% of GDP). The countries selected are India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
